2. Create a program that prompts for 2 numbers and then outputs the addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division of the first number by the second number.
'''

num_one = int(input("Please enter a whole number"))
num_two = int(input("Please enter another whole number"))
add = num_one + num_two
sub = num_one - num_two
mult = num_one * num_two
div = num_one/num_two

print(f"Your first number added to the second number is {add}. Your first number subtracted from the second number is {sub}. Your first number multiplied by the second number is {mult}. And finally your first number divided by the second number is {div}.")
