'''3. Create a program that prompts for the side lengths of a triangle and computes the area using Heron's formula.

b = int(input("What is the value for the second side? Please use a whole number:"))
c = int(input("What is the value for the third side? Please use a whole number:"))

s = 1/2 * (a + b + c)

import math

A = math.sqrt(h)
print(f"Thank you for providing that. The area of a triangle with side {a}, side {b}, and side {c} is {A}.")
